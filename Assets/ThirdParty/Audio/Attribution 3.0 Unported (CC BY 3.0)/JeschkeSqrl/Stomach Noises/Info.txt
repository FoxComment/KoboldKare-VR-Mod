These are all stomach sounds recorded by me, Jeschke!

These range in quality, as I was going through several microphone upgrades over the course of recording these. It can also be difficult to pick up very quiet ones without microphone noise. Any file that has "quiet" in front of it was normalized to -10 dB, because boosting them louder made digital noise stand out more. I would recommend a lo-pass for those situations!

The SM57 recordings are the oldest, followed by the NT5 and finally the X2.

I also have a large pack of more stomach sounds that was recorded with a Tascam handheld audio recorder; if you wish to grab those then go here: https://www.furaffinity.net/view/25086029/ or directly to here: http://www.mediafire.com/file/vyjd7c45ykyz67y/Stomach_Sounds_101217.zip/file

This pack was recorded and made by Jeschke! All sounds within are free to use for your vorish animations, games, or what-have-you, whether you use them as-is or edit them. If you use some of the sounds in your projects, attribution would be nice, but it isn't necessary. If you want to officially license these for a large commercial product, like a video game or movie, or such, then I'd love to discuss licensing and payment and such. (But since I'll be distributing these on FA and Eka's Portal and since I'm not a professional foley recorder, I kind of doubt that will happen.)
