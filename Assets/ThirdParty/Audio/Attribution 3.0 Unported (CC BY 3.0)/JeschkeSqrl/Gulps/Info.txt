Various gulps! Most of them were recorded up close to my throat, I believe, with the exception of the openmouthedgulps from recording 2. All of them are normalized to 0 dB, so, y'know, don't have your volume up to full blast when listening!

If anything I would be cautious with some of the ones from recording 3. That's one where I ran the signal through a preamp twice, hoping for a very powerful sound. But in some cases, for instance, the one called painfullydirect.wav? It's painfully directly into your ears if you have headphones on. But out of the spirit of wanting to share my complete library, good or bad, I didn't go taking anything out of these collections!

This pack was recorded and made by Jeschke! All sounds within are free to use for your vorish animations, games, or what-have-you, whether you use them as-is or edit them. If you use some of the sounds in your projects, attribution would be nice, but it isn't necessary. If you want to officially license these for a large commercial product, like a video game or movie, or such, then I'd love to discuss licensing and payment and such. (But since I'll be distributing these on FA and Eka's Portal and since I'm not a professional foley recorder, I kind of doubt that will happen.)
