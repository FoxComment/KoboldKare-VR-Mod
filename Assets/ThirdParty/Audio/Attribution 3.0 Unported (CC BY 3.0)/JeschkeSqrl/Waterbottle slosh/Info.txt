A bunch of water sloshing around in a waterbottle, probably recorded way too close for their own good!

But hey, maybe lower the volume and EQ it and you've got some sloshy noises for whatever you might need them for. :3

This pack was recorded and made by Jeschke! All sounds within are free to use for your vorish animations, games, or what-have-you, whether you use them as-is or edit them. If you use some of the sounds in your projects, attribution would be nice, but it isn't necessary. If you want to officially license these for a large commercial product, like a video game or movie, or such, then I'd love to discuss licensing and payment and such. (But since I'll be distributing these on FA and Eka's Portal and since I'm not a professional foley recorder, I kind of doubt that will happen.)
