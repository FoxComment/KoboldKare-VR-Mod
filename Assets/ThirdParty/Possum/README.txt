It basically means you can do whatever you want with this avatar as long as you credit me by linking my website or profiles, which I put below.

I have also created an online texture editor that allows you to easily change the colors of the Possum, see here: https://assets.1029chris.ca/PossumEditor/editor.html

To use textures created with the editor, simply swap out the albedo texture with the one downloaded from the website.

The VRC SDK is required to use this as an avatar in VRChat.

For Dynamic Bones to work, you'll need the dynamic bone plugin from the asset store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743

When uploading the Oculus Quest version, switch the target build of Unity to Android, apply the Quest material, delete all the dynamic bones, and upload.

Have fun with it!
